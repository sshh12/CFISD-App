## What
The CFISD app was built as a utility for both Android and Apple users. The app includes ways to access
news, grades, attendance, teachers, and more with the option to change between schools with ease. In order to access
grades and other information, the app uses the unoffical [CFISD API](https://github.com/sshh12/CyRanch-App-Server).
